The World Wide Web is a huge network of hyperlinked documents (contain links in the text of a Web site you can click on) that are accessible over the Internet. These documents contain links to related supporting graphics, images, videos, and to other documents, and are usually grouped together as a Web site and stored on a computer connected to the Internet (Web Host) and are viewed with a Web browser on a computer or other smart device.
